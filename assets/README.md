# Twitter Client Sample

Created by: Masa Tanaka ([@massie](http://twitter.com/massie))

## Tested Environments

This sample will work with most newer Cordova/PhoneGap versions.
If you use [Monaca](http://monaca.mobi/), a cloud-based development environment for PhoneGap, you can easily import the project and run on your device instantly. 

* iOS 7 (iPad)
* Android 4.2 Smartphone

## Setup and run

The app uses Twitter REST API. Therefore, you need to create your app, and obtain your own Consumer Key and Consumer Secret by visiting [Twitter Developer](http://dev.twitter.com/).

1. Access to [Monaca](http://monaca.mobi/) website and sign up.
2. When you create a new project, select import.
3. Do import from the following URL: https://github.com/monaca/sample-twitter-client.git
4. Open IDE. Your project is ready now.
5. Open index.html, and type in your Consumer Key and Consumer Secret. It's around line 20.
6. If you want to run on your device, install our [Monaca Debugger](http://docs.monaca.mobi/en/manual/debugger/installation_index/), where the magic happens.
